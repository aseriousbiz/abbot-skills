# Abbot Skills

Source code to our most popular and interesting [Abbot](https://ab.bot/) skills. 

At the moment, Abbot supports writing skills using C#, JavaScript, and Python. Skills are written in-browser with our Skill Editor. There is no support _yet_ for using an version control software such as Git or GitHub to collaborate on skill code. So for the time being, we'll use this repository and a manual process to allow for collaboration on skills.

All skills are in the skills directory.
